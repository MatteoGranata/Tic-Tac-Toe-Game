## Site

### Home Page
The website opens with the game rules. By clicking anywhere on the screen, the rules will disappear, and the game table will appear. Below the title, the current player will be indicated, and beneath the table, the scores will be displayed along with the button to reset the table.

### Structure
The page is structured in a minimal and intuitive vertical layout, featuring only essential elements: the game's name, the current player, the game table, the scores for wins and ties, and the restart button to reset the table.


### Instructions for use

The operation is very intuitive: by clicking anywhere on the table, the symbol corresponding to the current player's turn will be marked. When the game concludes, the winning player will appear below the scores, or if it's a tie. To start a new game, simply press the "RESTART" button, and the table will reset, while the scores will be saved.
